# Link Shortener

This project is exciting as it is a link shortener and tracking tool like Bitly, where you can create shorter URLs for any webpage and track how many clicks each gets. Users can add new links directly from the application and store their data in the administrative panel in Django.

If no links are displayed, the application shows a message informing the user, "No links stored in the database," prompting you to add one.
